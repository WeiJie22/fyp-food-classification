# fyp-food-classification
This is my Final Year Project. I plan to build an image classification model that can classify food categories and predict the calories intake. The final model weight will be used in my mobile application developed using Flutter. MobileNetV3 is chosen due to the size of the model, and the weights can be put inside my mobile application (on edge) for faster inference.

## Transfer Learning 
Model used - MobileNetV3

Datasets used - Food11 Datasets + Datasets from Roboflow Universe (Secondary Dataset Collection)
